# Simuation Project of the Flexible Automation course (MSc Robotics Engineering, Unige)

## Virtual Prototyping of a Robotics Work Cell with CoppeliaSim

Prototype solution for one of problem in their loading and unloading station. The station receives three different kind of boxes which it segregate and load it to the appropriate
loading line. The respository contain the design a flexible manufacturing cell (FMC) with robot centered layout for the above function. The design handle the following requirements:

1. Ability to supply multiple vendors at the same time
2. Fully automated solution from product in to out
3. Flexible in terms of volume and mix product handling
